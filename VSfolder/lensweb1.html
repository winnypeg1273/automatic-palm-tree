        Have you ever looked at a photographic masterpiece and wondered how the photographer managed to capture it? Here’s a not-so-secret secret: It’s in the lenses. How you choose and use them can make the difference between an ordinary shot and a compelling work. The first step is to know your options. Here’s an introduction to the different types of lenses and what they do.

    <h3 class="sublens">Different lenses let you see the same scene in different ways</h2>
    <p class="para">
        The features and specifications you find in DSLR and mirrorless camera bodies can help you take amazing shots, but when it comes to creative expression, the key is in the lens.
    </p>
    <p class="para">

        Each type of lens has its own unique set of characteristics, which you can harness for different scenes and shooting intentions. From jaw-dropping shots of vast landscapes that go on forever, mysterious close-ups of roses, the action and dynamism of motorsports, and many more, interchangeable lenses provide you with a range of visual expression not possible with a smartphone camera.
    </p>
    <p class="para">          
        For some examples, take a look at the following.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sublens">Wide-angle lenses</h3>
    <img src="https://d1hjkbq40fs2x4.cloudfront.net/2018-06-27/files/ef11-24mm-f4l-usm-sample-image_1825-1.jpg" alt="img1">
    <p class="spec">
        EOS 5D Mark III/ EF11-24mm f/4L USM/ FL: 11mm/ Aperture-priority AE (f/8.0, 1/500sec, EV±0)/ ISO 100/ WB: Auto<br>
        Shot with: Ultra-wide-angle lens<br>
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        <span class="textbold"><a href="http://snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/lens-basics-6-wide-angle-lenses">Wide-angle lenses</a> capture a field-of-view that is wider than what the human eye can see.</span>  For this reason, they are often used to photograph vast landscapes.
    </p>
    <p class="para">    
        A lens is considered to be wide-angle if its focal length is 35mm and below. If its focal length is 24mm or shorter, it is considered an <b>ultra-wide-angle lens</b>. 
    </p>
    <p class="para">     
        Wide-angle lenses also <b><a href="http://snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/lens-basics-6-wide-angle-lenses">exaggerate perspective</a></b>, i.e., they can make nearby objects look bigger and nearer, and faraway objects look smaller and even further away. This characteristic is often used in <a href="https://snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/architectural-photography-1-3-basic-concepts">architectural photography</a> to make buildings look more impactful.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        Because of the abovementioned strengths in capturing scenery and architecture, wide-angle (including ultra-wide-angle) lenses are great to have on hand when you travel.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sublens">Macro lenses</h3>
    <img src="https://d1hjkbq40fs2x4.cloudfront.net/2018-06-27/files/ef-s35mm-f2-8-macro-is-stm-sample-image_1825-2.jpg" alt="macro">
    <p class="spec">
        EOS 800D/EF-S35mm f/2.8 Macro IS STM/ FL: 35mm/ Aperture-priority AE(f/9, 0.5sec, EV-1.7)/ ISO 400/ WB: Manual<br>
        Type of lens: Macro
    </p>
    <p class="para">
       <a href="https://snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/uncover-a-whole-new-world-with-macro-lenses">Macro lenses</a> are ideal for photographing plants, insects, food, trinkets and accessories, and other small subjects.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        This is because they have:
    </p>
    <p class="spec">
        - A <b>very close focusing distance</b>, which means that you can photograph your subject by putting your lens very close to it<br>
        - A <b>magnification ratio of at least 1:1</b>, which means that you can still achieve <b>life-size close-ups</b> where the subject fills the frame. 
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        Macro lenses have a <b>very shallow depth-of-field:</b> Only subjects that are very close to the camera will be sharp and in-focus. The surrounding areas will be out-of-focus and blurred with an aesthetic quality called ‘<a href="">bokeh</a>’, which makes subjects pop.
    </p>
    <p class="para">    
        In fact, because of their ability to create <b>beautiful background bokeh</b>, macro lenses are also often used for portrait photography. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="sublens">Telephoto lens</h3>
    <img src="https://d1hjkbq40fs2x4.cloudfront.net/2018-06-27/files/ef100-400mm-f4-5-5-6l-is-ii-usm-sample-image_1825-3.jpg" alt="telephoto">
    <p class="spec">
        EOS-1D X/ EF100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM/ FL: 200mm/ Manual exposure (f/14, 1/60sec, EV±0)/ ISO 50/ WB: Auto<br>
        Type of lens: Telephoto
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        <a href="snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/lens-basics-8-telephoto-lenses">Telephoto lenses</a> <b>“pull in” photographic subjects that are far away</b> and make them look bigger and nearer than they really are. They are ideal for photographing wildlife, sports, car and bike races, and any other subject that is hard for you to shoot from up close.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        Telephoto lenses are also known for their <a href="https://snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/lens-faq-7-what-is-the-difference-between-a-200mm-and-300mm-telephoto-lens">compression effect</a>, which <b>makes objects look closer to each other.</b>
    </p>
    <p class="spec">
    Compared to standard (normal) lenses, telephoto lenses can <b>capture images with a larger background blur</b>. This is due to two reasons:<br> 
    i) A shallower depth-of-field<br>
    ii) Out-of-focus distant objects are also "pulled-in" and magnified, so the blurred areas look bigger.<br>
     You can use this characteristic to blur out distracting background elements and focus the viewer’s attention on your subject.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        A fourth significant characteristic of telephoto lenses is that they <b>result in less distortion</b> compared to other types of lenses such as wide-angle lenses, which makes them ideal for portraiture.
    </p>
    <p class="spec">
        There are three subcategories of telephoto lenses:<br>
        - Telephoto prime lenses: <a href="snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/lens-basics-2-prime-lenses">Prime lenses</a> with focal length 135mm or more<br>
        - Super telephoto prime lenses: Prime lenses with focal length 300mm or more<br>
        - Telephoto zoom lenses: <a href="snapshot.canon-asia.com/article/en/lens-basics-1-zoom-lenses">Zoom lenses</a> with a telephoto end of 200mm or more.
