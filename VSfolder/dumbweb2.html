    <h1>THE 5 CATCHIEST BLACK METAL SONGS</h1>
    <p>
        Here are 5 black metal songs that are actually really catchy.
        
        When you think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwPwduJ3G5I">black metal</a>, you probably think of at least a few central characteristics (such as high-pitched shrieking, tremolo guitar picking, haunting atmospheres, feisty tempos, lo-fi production, paganistic themes, corpse paint and maybe even Scandinavian church burnings).      
        
        What’s less commonly tied to the subgenre are sing-along melodies, tuneful instrumental passages and/or other overtly accessible attributes.

        That’s not to say that it never happens, though.

    <p>
        Just listen to the 5 tracks on the list for proof, as each of them is an undeniable earworm for one reason or another. Whether they fit into traditional black metal or branch into other styles – symphonic, folk, etc. – they’re guaranteed to get stuck in your head.
    </p>

    <h2>"Fuel for Hatred" (Satyricon)</h2>

    <p>
        Taken from the <a href="https://loudwire.com/tags/satyricon/">Norwegian group</a>’s fifth LP – 2002’s <i>Volcano</i> – “Fuel for Hatred” deservingly won the 2003 Alarm Award for Song of the Year.

        It’s the band’s most attractive piece, not only because of its simple but gripping lead guitar riffs but also because of frontman Sigurd “Satyr” Wongraven’s immediate and punchy verses and lyrics. Of course, the chorus is downright anthemic, too, with the subsequent sludgy instrumental break (about halfway through) pulling you in via back-and-forth rhythmic hypnosis before resolving back into the frenetic core of the composition.
    
        Honestly, it mirrors the structure of many mainstream pop and rock hits.

    <h2>"Freezing Moon" (Mayhem)</h2>

    <p>
        Mayhem is arguably the most <a href="https://loudwire.com/mayhem-lords-of-chaos-trailer/">infamous part</a> of the early Norwegian black metal scene, and although they’re largely known for their <a href="https://loudwire.com/most-controversial-hard-rock-metal-album-covers/">violent history</a>, they’ve also produced some bona fide black metal bangers. Case in point: the immensely popular “Freezing Moon” from 1994’s <a href="https://loudwire.com/top-black-metal-albums-of-all-time/">seminal</a> <i>De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas</i>.

        Its visceral blend of doomy riffs and combative rhythms might as well be the compelling soundtrack to arriving at the gates of Hell, with its periodic fluctuations enhancing the allure.

        Meanwhile, Attila “Void” Csihar’s sluggishly foreboding – and increasingly demonic – vocals are somewhat incongruous, so “Freezing Moon” is curiously soothing and sinister at once.

    <h2>“Clouds Retiring” (Pure Wrath)</h2>

    <p>
        Truth be told, several compositions from Pure Wrath’s 2017 full-length debut – <i>Ascetic Eventide</i> – could’ve taken this spot since mastermind Januaryo Hardy filled it with numerous top-tier entries. “Clouds Retiring” gets the gold, though, because it’s just so damn beautiful.

        Early on, the smoothly flowing staccato playing and melodic verses do enough to lure audiences in; yet, it’s the sudden dip into cleanly plucked guitar notes and orchestral timbres about midway through that wholly envelops us in gorgeous vehemence. Then, the original arrangement returns until the final minute, when it converts into an awe-inspiring collage of rainfall and introspective pianowork that – like all that preceded it – demands to be hummed repeatedly.

    <h2>"Falling Snow" (Agalloch)</h2>

    <p>
        Despite not quite besting predecessor <i>The Mantle</i> as the quintessential wintertime folk/post-black metal record, <a href="https://loudwire.com/tags/agalloch/">Agalloch</a>’s third full-length collection (<i><a href="https://loudwire.com/10-best-metal-albums-2006/">Ashes Against the Grain</a></i>) nevertheless housed plenty of icy splendor.

        Look no further than the absolutely addictive guitar/drum synthesis that kicks off “Falling Snow.” Both components remain resourcefully captivating until the very end, too, highlighting the imaginative fluidity that’s always made the group’s chemistry so unique. Likewise, singer John Haughm provides some of Agalloch’s superlative hooks, urging listeners to emulate every one of his guttural observations and cleanly sung laments.

        Even the discordant atmospheres and transitions that connect those passages are spellbinding.

    <h2>“Blood on the Milky Way” (Sear Bliss)</h2>

    <p>
        Hailing from Hungary, Sear Bliss specialize in the atmospheric side of the style, and in addition to having an innately intriguing title, “Blood on the Milky Way” (from 2007’s <i>The Arcade Odyssey</i>) illustrates how eclectically enticing they can be.

        The first few minutes are definitely engaging – if typical – but it’s the dichotomy of horns and supportive six-string riffs a quarter of the way through that surprises as much as it entrances. Similarly, the combination of acoustic arpeggios and ethereal tones shortly thereafter – and spread across the remainder of the song – are equally engrossing, and once the horns come back, “Blood on the Milky Way” becomes unavoidably hypnotic.

        Of course, the bittersweet coda is mesmeric as well.
